# Test Cases To Do

1. An empty template, but with a full template.json with transforms, does not error and results in empty project folder (assuming .template.config excluded)
2. A basic project with a package.json, ignored files, included files, and globs that don't match until depth.
3. A project that exercises the configurations section.
4. A project that exercises inputs.
5. A project that uses plugins (?).
6. Handler loading lib/handler-service.ts
7. Listing templates
