# Alternate Root Demo Project

This project shows another way to organize your template projects. Instead of dropping your `.neoman.config`
folder into your project folder, you can avoid polluting its directory structure by specifying an alternate
root folder for the template source. Use the `root` element in your `.neoman.config/template.json` file to
specify a path parallel to the `.neoman.config` folder that will contain your template's source files.
